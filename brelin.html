              Brelin
            </h1>
        <p>Brelin is a conlang created in the mid of 2022. It is made out of 40 words, that can be used together to create new ones, either with a hypher or just gluing them together.</p>
        <p>It is important to understand that it is flexible, meaning that it can usually change, depending on the context.</p>
        <p>The grammar itself is pretty simple, being very similar to languages like English, Toki Pona and Indonesian.</p>
        <p>The words, though, are pretty different than usual, being inspired by Slavic languages (like Russian, Polish and etc) and other conlangs, like Brenewvian (which you can find a learning guide also in this website).</p>

          Grammar
        </p>
        <p>Brelin has no genders, no articles and no time conjugation. Actually, all of that is either determined by the context or by a word, that can go in the end or in the beggining of a sentence. The only rules that you'll have to remember while speaking this language is the connection of senses (For example, to say "She went to the hospital", instead of using "to", you'd have to use a unniversal connector, that is "kapa'i") and the creation of senses by connecting two words (When you want to have two words together, you should pay attention to the size of them. If the total number of letters of the words that you wanna combine is <10, you can just glue them toguether, but if the sum is >10 or have a accent, you'll have to use a hiphen when combining them [For example: hende + ho = hendeho; hendeho + noik = hendeho-noik]).</p>

          Pronounciation
        </p>
	<p>The brelin pronounciation is really easy to understand if you already speak a latin language (like Spanish and Portuguese). The vogals pronounciations are:</p>
	<p style="color: grey;">Attention: All the teaching here will use the american english accent to guide!</p>
	<p>A: The first letter of the brelinen alphabet is pronounced like the first letter of "Outer space";</p>
	<p>E: This letter is pronounced like the second word of "cat";</p>
	<p>I: This letter is pronounced like the second and third word of "bee";</p>
	<p>O: This letter is pronounced like the second word of "noah";</p>
	<p>U: This letter is pronounced like the second and third word of "cool".</p> 
	<p>As you can see, it's pretty easy to understand it, as long as you compare it with english words.</p>
	<p>If you want to know more about this language, get prepared because I'll develop a page in this website to talk more about it! Get ready!</p>
	<p style="font-size: 25px; color: lightseagreen;">Resume</p>
	<p>Overall, we define Brelin as mix of languages, having its pronounciation based of languages like Latin and Spanish, and its words based of Slavic languages, like Russian and Polish. For me, it's not the easiest conlang to learn, but definitely interesting knowing its system and rules.</p>
