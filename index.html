    Thoughts
      </h1>
      <p style="font-size: 20px; color: grey;">Discussiable projects and theories that I've done and had recently, newest to oldest. Created by Nicolas Jamal.</p>

      What I want to 2024
      </h1>
      <p>As I'm writing this, 2023 will end in just a few hours. Because of that, I decided to tell you, readers, what I want for this website in the next year.</p>
      <p style="font-size: 20px; color: lightseagreen;">Style</p>
      <p>I don't know if it's just me, but I think the style of this website feels too old and too simple. I feel like it'd be nice if I updated all of that. I don't know if I'll be capable of doing something much better, but let's see, right? :)</p>
      <p style="font-size: 20px; color: lightseagreen;">Neocities -> Github</p>
      <p>Yet neocities is indeed a really good service for hosting your website, I don't feel comfortable here... It's that normally people don't hosts blogs here, just some silly old-styled websites. Because of that, I'm planning on moving to neocities, but I'm still not certain of that.</p>
      <p style="font-size: 20px; color: lightseagreen;">Better articles</p>
      <p>Keeping my website full of random articles is really bad. I feel like I should put each article on its own html page, to maybe make people less confused about this website.</p>

      Jamal Scientto is up!
      </h1>
      <p style="font-size: 20px; color: lightseagreen;">Why is this?</p>
      <p>After about 2 weeks, I decided to get my old personal website (that means it's not going to be updated anymore) up again, since I've already released this one. <a href="https://jamal-scientto.glitch.me">Access it now</a> if you want to see how my website used to look like.</p>
      <p style="font-size: 20px; color: lightseagreen;">Won't you put all of its content here, too?</p>
      <p>You can find way more content on my old website than this one, but I can assure you that this website will have even more, after I update it to its final form. G'day!</p>

      Opinions on FreeBSD after a fresh install
      </h1>
      <p style="font-size: 20px; color: lightseagreen;">Why did I install it?</p>
      <p>Some days ago, I decided to do something that I've always wanted to do: Intall FreeBSD or any BSD related OS on a physical machine. And so, I decided to do it on my secondary PC, that pretty low-end for now. At first, I had no clue on how to even start installing it, but I followed a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8O6cKRHvoo">simple tutorial</a> that made it easier to understand.</p>
      <p style="font-size: 20px; color: lightseagreen;">Did I like it?</p>
      <p>The answer to that question is a instant yes! I like everything about this OS, its shell, its speed and its compatibility. I wouldn't use it in my main computer (because of driver problems), but I totally recommend it if you install it on either a thinkpad or a old computer that lies around in your house.</p>
      <h1>An astronomist's diary</h1>
      <p style="font-size: 20px; color: grey;">Here you'll find interesting stuff about astronomy that I want to fix in my blog.</p>
      <p style="font-size: 20px; color: lightseagreen;">The laziest representation ever</p>
      <img src="solarsys.png" width="300" height="200"></img><p>So... In october or so, I decided to start learning the usage processing. My first project was a drawing of the solar system, that looked pretty good, considering my skills; But astronomically, this has got to be the most lazy and out of scale drawing I've ever seen. What do you think of it? I guess it could be way better... :p</p>
