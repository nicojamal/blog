	The creator
</h1>
	<p>Hello guys! My name is Nicolas Jamal and I am the creator of this website. I am 13 years old and this is my 9th website, which I decided to create to make people actually belive this is a serious blog, not just a random old-styled neocities website. I don't think a lot of people will access it, but I hope this will at least be a substitute for all my other websites. And if you're asking, you're connected to a website that was created with nano.</p>
	<h1 style="color: lightseagreen">Plans for the blog</h1>
	<p>For me, the website is good enough for what I want it to do. But if I have a chance of improving it, I think I would buy a domain (like nicojamal.com.br or maybe nicojamal.org) and expand it, making it look like even more professional.</p>
	<h1 style="color: lightseagreen;">Contact</h1>
	<p>If you really want to contact me, it's best to use my yahoo, "nmhshin@yahoo.com".</p>
