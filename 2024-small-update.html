	<h1>Small update for July</h1>
	<p>Greetings, readers. I'm back with some updated to my blog.</p>
  <p>Recently I was busy with school but managed to update my website and remove things that didn't work anymore. As such, I removed "Blog do Nicolas", as this translated subsite didn't work since I moved to github.</p>
    <h1 style="color: lightseagreen;">Bye for now!</h1>
