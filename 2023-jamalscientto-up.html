      Jamal Scientto is up!
      </h1>
      <p style="font-size: 20px; color: lightseagreen;">Why is this?</p>
      <p>After about 2 weeks, I decided to get my old personal website (that means it's not going to be updated anymore) up again, since I've already released this one. <a href="https://jamal-scientto.glitch.me">Access it now</a> if you want to see how my old website looks like.</p>
      <p style="font-size: 20px; color: lightseagreen;">Won't you put all of its content here, too?</p>
      <p>You can find way more content on my old website than this one, but I can assure you that this website will have even more, after I update it to its final form. G'day!</p>
